        Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) regularly circulate between wild and domestic bird populations. Following several high-profile outbreaks, highly pathogenic AIVs (HPAIV) with zoonotic potential have been the subject of increasing attention. While we know that HPAIV is transmitted between domestic birds, wildlife, and the environment, little is known about persistence and spillover/back at these interfaces. We integrated the test results of samples collected on and around an infected domestic poultry premise (IP) where H5N1 HPAIV was confirmed in a flock of poultry in 2022 in Southern Ontario, Canada to explore the transmission cycle of AIVs in wildlife and the environment. We sampled a captive flock of Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) that resided on site, sediment samples collected from water bodies on site, and examined samples collected through surveillance within a 100 km radius of the IP from live wild ducks and sick and dead wildlife. We found serologic evidence of H5 exposure in the captive mallards that resided on site despite no evidence of morbidity or mortality in these birds and no PCR positive detections from samples collected at two different timepoints. Genetic material from the same H5N1 HPAIV subtype circulating in the domestic birds and from low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses were detected in wetlands on site. The results of live and sick and dead surveillance conducted within a 100 km radius confirmed that the virus was circulating in wildlife before and after IP confirmation. These results suggest that biosecurity remains the most critical aspect of minimising spillover/back risk in a virus that has been shown to circulate in asymptomatic wild birds and persist in the surrounding environment.

        Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 has caused the deaths of more than 100 million birds since 2021, and human cases since 1997 have been associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Given recent detections of HPAI H5N1 in dairy cattle and H5N1 RNA detections in pasteurized retail milk in the United States, we established the pan-Canadian Milk Network in April 2024. Through our network of collaborators from across Canada, retail milk was procured longitudinally, approximately every 2 weeks, and sent to a central laboratory to test for the presence of influenza A virus RNA. Between 29 April and 17 July 2024, we tested 109 retail milk samples from all 10 Canadian provinces (NL, NS, PEI, NB, QC, ON, MB, SK, AB, and BC). All samples tested negative for influenza A virus RNA. This nationwide initiative was established for rapid retail milk screening as per the earliest reports of similar undertakings in the United States. Our independent testing results have aligned with reporting from federal retail milk testing initiatives. Despite no known HPAI infections of dairy cattle in Canada to date, H5N1 poses a significant threat to the health of both humans and other animals. By performing routine surveillance of retail milk on a national scale, we have shown that academic networks and initiatives can rapidly establish nationwide emerging infectious disease surveillance that is cost-effective, standardized, scalable, and easily accessible. Our network can serve as an early detection system to help inform containment and mitigation activities if positive samples are identified and can be readily reactivated should HPAI H5N1 or other emerging zoonotic viruses be identified in agricultural or livestock settings, including Canadian dairy cattle.

        Canada experienced a wave of HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in the spring of 2022 with millions of wild and farmed birds being infected. Seabird mortalities in Canada have been particularly severe on the Atlantic Coast over the summer of 2022. Over 7 million birds have been culled in Canada, and outbreaks continue to profoundly affect commercial bird farms across the world. This new H5N1 virus can and has infected multiple mammalian species, including skunks, foxes, bears, mink, seals, porpoises, sea lions, and dolphins. Viruses with mammalian adaptations such as the mutations PB2-E627K, E627V, and D701N were found in the brain of various carnivores in Europe and Canada. To date this specific clade of H5N1 virus has been identified in less than 10 humans. At the ground level, awareness should be raised among frontline practitioners most likely to encounter patients with HPAI.

        Avian influenza is endemic in Bangladesh, where greater than 90% of poultry are marketed through live poultry markets (LPMs). We conducted a population-based cross-sectional mobile telephone survey in urban Dhaka, Bangladesh to investigate the frequency and patterns of human exposure to live poultry in LPMs and at home. Among 1047 urban residents surveyed, 74.2% (95% CI 70.9-77.2) reported exposure to live poultry in the past year, with the majority of exposure occurring on a weekly basis. While visiting LPMs was less common amongst females (40.3%, 95% CI 35.0-45.8) than males (58.9%, 95% CI 54.0-63.5), females reported greater poultry exposure through food preparation, including defeathering (13.2%, 95% CI 9.5-17.9) and eviscerating (14.8%, 95% CI 11.2-19.4) (p &lt; 0.001). A large proportion of the urban population is frequently exposed to live poultry in a setting where avian influenza viruses are endemic in LPMs. There is thus not only ample opportunity for spillover of avian influenza infections into humans in Dhaka, Bangladesh, but also greater potential for viral reassortment which could generate novel strains with pandemic potential.

        <AbstractText Label=""OBJECTIVES"">Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 binds and inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme-2. The frequency of acute cardiac injury in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 is unknown. The objective was to compare the rates of cardiac injury by angiotensin-converting enzyme-2-binding viruses from viruses that do not bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2.
        <AbstractText Label=""DATA SOURCES"">We performed a systematic review of coronavirus disease 2019 literature on PubMed and EMBASE.
        <AbstractText Label=""STUDY SELECTION"">We included studies with ten or more hospitalized adults with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 or other viral pathogens that described the occurrence of acute cardiac injury. This was defined by the original publication authors or by: 1) myocardial ischemia, 2) new cardiac arrhythmia on echocardiogram, or 3) new or worsening heart failure on echocardiogram.
        <AbstractText Label=""DATA EXTRACTION"">We compared the rates of cardiac injury among patients with respiratory infections with viruses that down-regulate angiotensin-converting enzyme-2, including H1N1, H5N1, H7N9, and severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-1, to those with respiratory infections from other influenza viruses that do not bind angiotensin-converting enzyme-2, including Influenza H3N2 and influenza B.
        <AbstractText Label=""DATA SYNTHESIS"">Of 57 studies including 34,072 patients, acute cardiac injury occurred in 50% (95% CI, 44-57%) of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019. The overall risk of acute cardiac injury was 21% (95% CI, 18-26%) among hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019. In comparison, 37% (95% CI, 26-49%) of critically ill patients with other respiratory viruses that bind angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (p = 0.061) and 12% (95% CI, 7-22%) of critically ill patients with other respiratory viruses that do not bind angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (p &lt; 0.001) experienced a cardiac injury.
        <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Acute cardiac injury may be associated with whether the virus binds angiotensin-converting enzyme-2.

"12","33096342","Quantifying mechanistic traits of influenza viral dynamics using in vitro data.","
        When analysing in vitro data, growth kinetics of influenza virus strains are often compared by computing their growth rates, which are sometimes used as proxies for fitness. However, analogous to mathematical models for epidemics, the growth rate can be defined as a function of mechanistic traits: the basic reproduction number (the average number of cells each infected cell infects) and the mean generation time (the average length of a replication cycle). Fitting a model to previously published and newly generated data from experiments in human lung cells, we compared estimates of growth rate, reproduction number and generation time for six influenza A strains. Of four strains in previously published data, A/Canada/RV733/2003 (seasonal H1N1) had the lowest basic reproduction number, followed by A/Mexico/INDRE4487/2009 (pandemic H1N1), then A/Indonesia/05/2005 (spill-over H5N1) and A/Anhui/1/2013 (spill-over H7N9). This ordering of strains was preserved for both generation time and growth rate, suggesting a positive biological correlation between these quantities which have not been previously observed. We further investigated these potential correlations using data from reassortant viruses with different internal proteins (from A/England/195/2009 (pandemic H1N1) and A/Turkey/05/2005 (H5N1)), and the same surface proteins (from A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (lab-adapted H1N1)). Similar correlations between traits were observed for these viruses, confirming our initial findings and suggesting that these patterns were related to the degree of human adaptation of internal genes. Also, the model predicted that strains with a smaller basic reproduction number, shorter generation time and slower growth rate underwent more replication cycles by the time of peak viral load, potentially accumulating mutations more quickly. These results illustrate the utility of mathematical models in inferring traits driving observed differences in in vitro growth of influenza strains.

        Deciphering complex virus-host interactions is crucial for pandemic preparedness. In this study, we assessed the impact of recently postulated cellular factors ANP32A and ANP32B of influenza A virus (IAV) species specificity on viral pathogenesis in a genetically modified mouse model. Infection of ANP32A-/- and ANP32A+/+ mice with a seasonal H3N2 IAV or a highly pathogenic H5N1 human isolate did not result in any significant differences in virus tropism, innate immune response or disease outcome. However, infection of ANP32B-/- mice with H3N2 or H5N1 IAV revealed significantly reduced virus loads, inflammatory cytokine response and reduced pathogenicity compared to ANP32B+/+ mice. Genome-wide transcriptome analyses in ANP32B+/+ and ANP32B-/- mice further uncovered novel immune-regulatory pathways that correlate with reduced pathogenicity in the absence of ANP32B. These data show that ANP32B but not ANP32A promotes IAV pathogenesis in mice. Moreover, ANP32B might possess a yet unknown immune-modulatory function during IAV infection. Targeting ANP32B or its regulated pathways might therefore pose a new strategy to combat severe influenza.

"14","31918040","The fit of codon usage of human-isolated avian influenza A viruses to human.","
        Avian influenza A viruses (AIVs) classify into 18 hemagglutinin (HA) and 11 neuraminidase (NA) subtypes. Even though H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes usually circulate among humans leading to infection, occasionally, H5, H6, H7, H9, and H10 that circulate in poultry also infect humans, and especially H5N1 and H7N9. Efficient virus replication is a critical factor that influences infection. Codon usage of a virus must coevolve with its host for efficient viral replication, therefore, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of codon usage bias in human-isolated AIVs to test their adaptation to host expression system. The relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) pattern, and the codon adaptation index (CAI) are calculated for this purpose. We find that all human-isolated AIVs tend to eliminate GC and CpG compositions, which may prevent activation of the host innate immune system. Although codon usage differs between AIV subtypes, our data support the conclusion that natural selection has played a major role and mutation pressure a minor role in shaping codon usage bias in all AIVs. Our efforts discover that codon usage of genes encoding surface proteins of H5N1, and the polymerase genes of H7N9 has better fit to the human expression system. This may associate with their better replication and infection in human.

        Outbreaks of severe virus infections with the potential to cause global pandemics are increasing. In many instances these outbreaks have been newly emerging (SARS coronavirus), re-emerging (Ebola virus, Zika virus) or zoonotic (avian influenza H5N1) virus infections. In the absence of a targeted vaccine or a pathogen-specific antiviral, broad-spectrum antivirals would function to limit virus spread. Given the direct antiviral effects of type I interferons (IFNs) in inhibiting the replication of both DNA and RNA viruses at different stages of their replicative cycles, and the effects of type I IFNs on activating immune cell populations to clear virus infections, IFNs-α/β present as ideal candidate broad-spectrum antivirals.

        Few viruses have shaped the course of human history more than influenza viruses. A century since the 1918-1919 Spanish influenza pandemic-the largest and deadliest influenza pandemic in recorded history-we have learned much about pandemic influenza and the origins of antigenic drift among influenza A viruses. Despite this knowledge, we remain largely underprepared for when the next major pandemic occurs.While emergency departments are likely to care for the first cases of pandemic influenza, intensive care units (ICUs) will certainly see the sickest and will likely have the most complex issues regarding resource allocation. Intensivists must therefore be prepared for the next pandemic influenza virus. Preparation requires multiple steps, including careful surveillance for new pandemics, a scalable response system to respond to surge capacity, vaccine production mechanisms, coordinated communication strategies, and stream-lined research plans for timely initiation during a pandemic. Conservative models of a large-scale influenza pandemic predict more than 170% utilization of ICU-level resources. When faced with pandemic influenza, ICUs must have a strategy for resource allocation as strain increases on the system.There are several current threats, including avian influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) viruses. As humans continue to live in closer proximity to each other, travel more extensively, and interact with greater numbers of birds and livestock, the risk of emergence of the next pandemic influenza virus mounts. Now is the time to prepare and coordinate local, national, and global efforts.

        Avian influenza A viruses (AIVs) H5N1, first identified in 1996, are highly pathogenic in domestic poultry and continue to occasionally infect humans. In this study, we sought to identify genetic changes that occurred during their multiple invasions to humans. We evaluated all available H5Nx AIV genomes. Significant signals of positive selection were detected in 29 host-shift branches. 126 parallel evolution sites were detected on these branches, including 17 well-known sites (such as T271A, A274T, T339M, Q591K, E627K, and D701N in PB2; A134V, D154N, S223N, and R497K in HA) that play roles in allowing AIVs to cross species barriers. Our study suggests that during human infections, H5Nx viruses have experienced adaptive evolution (positive selection and convergent evolution) that allowed them to adapt to their new host environments. Analyses of adaptive evolution should be useful in identifying candidate sites that play roles in human infections, which can be tested by functional experiments.

        Since 2013, the H7N9 avian influenza A virus (AIV) has caused human infections and to the extent of now surpassing H5N1. This raises an alarm about the potential of H7N9 to become a pandemic problem. Our compilation of the amino acid changes required for AIVs to cross the species-barrier discovers 58 that have very high proportions in both the human- and avian-isolated H7N9 viruses. These changes correspond with sporadic human infections that continue to occur in regions of avian infections. Among the six internal viral genes, amino acid changes do not differ significantly between H9N2 and H7N9, except for V100A in PA, and K526R, D627K, and D701N in PB2. H9N2 AIVs provide internal genes to H7N9. Most of the amino acid changes in H7N9 appear to come directly from H9N2. Seventeen amino acid substitutions appear to have fixed quickly by the 5th wave. Among these, six amino acid sites in HA1 are receptor binding sites, and PB2-A588V was shown to promote the adaptation of AIVs to mammals. The accelerated fixation of mutations may promote the adaptation of H7N9 to human, but need further functional evidence. Although H7N9 AIVs still cannot efficiently transmit between humans, they have the genetic makeup associated with human infections. These viruses must be controlled in poultry to remove the threat of it becoming a human pandemic event.

        <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"">Avian influenza A H5N1 virus can cause lethal disease in humans. The virus can trigger severe pneumonia and lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Data from clinical, in vitro and in vivo suggest that virus-induced cytokine dysregulation could be a contributory factor to the pathogenesis of human H5N1 disease. However, the precise mechanism of H5N1 infection eliciting the unique host response are still not well understood.
        <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">To obtain a better understanding of the molecular events at the earliest time points, we used RNA-Seq to quantify and compare the host mRNA and miRNA transcriptomes induced by the highly pathogenic influenza A H5N1 (A/Vietnam/3212/04) or low virulent H1N1 (A/Hong Kong/54/98) viruses in human monocyte-derived macrophages at 1-, 3-, and 6-h post infection.
        <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Our data reveals that two macrophage populations corresponding to M1 (classically activated) and M2 (alternatively activated) macrophage subtypes respond distinctly to H5N1 virus infection when compared to H1N1 virus or mock infection, a distinction that could not be made from previous microarray studies. When this confounding variable is considered in our statistical model, a clear set of dysregulated genes and pathways emerges specifically in H5N1 virus-infected macrophages at 6-h post infection, whilst was not found with H1N1 virus infection. Furthermore, altered expression of genes in these pathways, which have been previously implicated in viral host response, occurs specifically in the M1 subtype. We observe a significant up-regulation of genes in the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway. In particular, interferons, and interferon-stimulated genes are broadly affected. The negative regulators of interferon signaling, the suppressors of cytokine signaling, SOCS-1 and SOCS-3, were found to be markedly up-regulated in the initial round of H5N1 virus replication. Elevated levels of these suppressors could lead to the eventual suppression of cellular antiviral genes, contributing to pathophysiology of H5N1 virus infection.
        <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Our study provides important mechanistic insights into the understanding of H5N1 viral pathogenesis and the multi-faceted host immune responses. The dysregulated genes could be potential candidates as therapeutic targets for treating H5N1 disease.

        <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">A dataset consisting of 1125 H5 HA sequences collected between 1996 and 2017 from avian and humans was assembled for phylogenetic and lineage-specific epitope analyses. Conserved epitopes were predicted from WHO-endorsed vaccine candidates and representative clade-defining strains by pairwise comparison with Immune Epitope Database (IEDB). The distribution of predicted epitopes was mapped to each HPAI H5 lineage. We assume that high similarity and conservancy of predicted epitopes from vaccine candidates among all circulating HPAI H5 lineages is correlated with high immunity.
        <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">A total of 49 conserved CD8+ T-cell epitopes were predicted at 28 different amino acid positions of the HA protein. Mapping these epitopes to the phylogenetic tree allowed us to develop epitope profiles, or ""fingerprints,"" for each HPAI H5 lineage. Vaccine epitope percentage analyses showed some epitope profiles were highly conserved for all H5 isolates and may be valuable for universal vaccine design. However, the positions with low coverage may explain why the vaccine candidates do not always function well.
        <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">These findings demonstrate that our analytical approach to evaluate conserved CD8+ T-cell epitope prediction in a phylogenetic framework may provide important insights for computational design of vaccine selection and future epitope-based design.

        The non-structural protein, NS1, is a virulence factor encoded by influenza A viruses (IAVs). In this report, we provide evidence that the conserved residue, tyrosine (Y) 84, in a conserved putative SH2-binding domain in A/Duck/Hubei/2004/L-1 [H5N1] NS1 is critical for limiting an interferon (IFN) response to infection. A phenylalanine (F) substitution of this Y84 residue abolishes NS1-mediated downregulation of IFN-inducible STAT phosphorylation, and surface IFNAR1 expression. Recombinant IAV (rIAV) [H1N1] expressing A/Grey Heron/Hong Kong/837/2004 [H5N1] NS1-Y84F (rWSN-GH-NS1-Y84F) replicates to lower titers in human lung epithelial cells and is more susceptible to the antiviral effects of IFN-β treatment compared with rIAV expressing the intact H5N1 NS1 (rWSN-GH-NS1-wt). Cells infected with rWSN-GH-NS1-Y84F express higher levels of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) associated with an antiviral response compared with cells infected with rWSN-GH-NS1-wt. In mice, intranasal infection with rWSN-GH-NS1-Y84F resulted in a delay in onset of weight loss, reduced lung pathology, lower lung viral titers and higher ISG expression, compared with mice infected with rWSN-GH-NS1-wt. IFN-β treatment of mice infected with rWSN-GH-NS1-Y84F reduced lung viral titers and increased lung ISG expression, but did not alter viral titers and ISG expression in mice infected with rWSN-GH-NS1-wt. Viewed altogether, these data suggest that the virulence associated with this conserved Y84 residue in NS1 is, in part, due to its role in regulating the host IFN response.

        There are gaps in the knowledge about the burden of severe respiratory disease in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR). This literature review was therefore conducted to describe the burden of epidemicand pandemic-prone acute respiratory infections (ARI) in the Region which may help in the development of evidence-based disease prevention and control policies. Relevant published and unpublished reports were identified from searches of various databases; 83 documents fulfilled the search criteria. The infections identified included: ARI, avian influenza A(H5N1), influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. Pneumonia and ARIs were leading causes of disease and death in the Region. Influenza A(H1N1) was an important cause of morbidity during the 2009 pandemic. This review provides a descriptive summary of the burden of acute respiratory diseases in the Region, but there still remains a lack of necessary data.

        Avian influenza viruses present an emerging epidemiological concern as some strains of H5N1 avian influenza can cause severe infections in humans with lethality rates of up to 60%. These have been in circulation since 1997 and recently a novel H7N9-subtyped virus has been causing epizootics in China with lethality rates around 20%. To better understand the replication kinetics of these viruses, we combined several extensive viral kinetics experiments with mathematical modelling of in vitro infections in human A549 cells. We extracted fundamental replication parameters revealing that, while both the H5N1 and H7N9 viruses replicate faster and to higher titers than two low-pathogenicity H1N1 strains, they accomplish this via different mechanisms. While the H7N9 virions exhibit a faster rate of infection, the H5N1 virions are produced at a higher rate. Of the two H1N1 strains studied, the 2009 pandemic H1N1 strain exhibits the longest eclipse phase, possibly indicative of a less effective neuraminidase activity, but causes infection more rapidly than the seasonal strain. This explains, in part, the pandemic strain's generally slower growth kinetics and permissiveness to accept mutations causing neuraminidase inhibitor resistance without significant loss in fitness. Our results highlight differential growth properties of H1N1, H5N1 and H7N9 influenza viruses.

        Next-generation sequencing technologies provide an unparallelled opportunity for the characterization and discovery of known and novel viruses. Because viruses are known to have the highest mutation rates when compared to eukaryotic and bacterial organisms, we assess the extent to which eleven well-known alignment algorithms (BLAST, BLAT, BWA, BWA-SW, BWA-MEM, BFAST, Bowtie2, Novoalign, GSNAP, SHRiMP2 and STAR) can be used for characterizing mutated and non-mutated viral sequences--including those that exhibit RNA splicing--in transcriptome samples. To evaluate aligners objectively we developed a realistic RNA-Seq simulation and evaluation framework (RiSER) and propose a new combined score to rank aligners for viral characterization in terms of their precision, sensitivity and alignment accuracy. We used RiSER to simulate both human and viral read sequences and suggest the best set of aligners for viral sequence characterization in human transcriptome samples. Our results show that significant and substantial differences exist between aligners and that a digital-subtraction-based viral identification framework can and should use different aligners for different parts of the process. We determine the extent to which mutated viral sequences can be effectively characterized and show that more sensitive aligners such as BLAST, BFAST, SHRiMP2, BWA-SW and GSNAP can accurately characterize substantially divergent viral sequences with up to 15% overall sequence mutation rate. We believe that the results presented here will be useful to researchers choosing aligners for viral sequence characterization using next-generation sequencing data.

        Highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 is a threat to global public health as a natural pandemic causing agent but has recently been considered a bioterrorism concern.  The evolving view of the H5N1 virus necessitates the re-evaluation of the current status of H5N1 therapeutics and prophylactics, in particular the preparation of viable H5N1 vaccination strategies as well as the use of ferrets in influenza research.  Here the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus dilemma is discussed in context with the current H5N1 vaccine status and the use of the ferret model.  Previously, the development of various H5N1 vaccine platforms have been attempted, many of them tested in the ferret model, including vector vaccines, adjuvant vaccines, DNA vaccines, and reverse engineered vaccines. Moreover, as ferrets are a superlative animal model for influenza investigation and vaccine testing, it is imperative that this model is recognized for its uses in prophylactic development and not only as an agent for creating transmissible influenza viruses.  Elucidating the ferret immune response and creating ferret immune reagents remain important goals in conjunction with the development and manufacture of H5N1 vaccines.  In summary, an efficacious H5N1 vaccine is urgently needed and the ferret model remains an appropriate model for its development.

        A dysregulated immune response and functional immunosuppression have been considered the major mechanisms of the bacterial sepsis syndrome. More recently, the loss of endothelial barrier function and resultant microvascular leak have been found to be a key determinant of the pathogenesis of bacterial sepsis. Whether a similar paradigm applies to systemic viral syndromes is not known. Answering this question has far-reaching implications for the development of future anti-viral therapeutic strategies. In this review, we provide an overview of the structure and function of the endothelium and how its barrier integrity is compromised in bacterial sepsis. The various in vitro and in vivo methodologies available to investigate vascular leak are reviewed. Emphasis is placed on the advantages and limitations of cell culture techniques, which represent the most commonly used methods. Within this context, we appraise recent studies of three viruses - hantavirus, human herpes virus 8 and dengue virus - that suggest microvascular leak may play a role in the pathogenesis of these viral infections. We conclude with a discussion of how endothelial barrier breakdown may occur in other viral infections such as H5N1 avian influenza virus.

        Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) strains have been causing sporadic cases of disease in South East Asia and Africa for many years. These cases are associated with a high fatality rate, and it is feared that the virus could evolve into a strain capable of causing a pandemic. It is likely that a requirement for a A(H5) pandemic to occur is a switch in the receptor affinity of the virus. Candidate mutations in the hemagglutinin glycoprotein have been identified in the literature, and their emergence in circulating viruses would be an ominous development. This study describes a method to identify the presence of these mutations, even within a quasispecies, using RT-PCR followed by in vitro translation and peptide characterization by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.

        The spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 remains a threat for both wild and domestic bird populations, while low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) strains have been reported to induce partial immunity to HPAI in poultry and some wild birds inoculated with both HPAI and LPAI strains. Here, based on the reported data and experiments, we develop a two-strain avian influenza model to examine the extent to which this partial immunity observed at the individual level can affect the outcome of the outbreaks among migratory birds in the wild at the population level during different seasons. We find a distinct mitigating effect of LPAI on the death toll induced by HPAI strain, and this effect is particularly important for populations previously exposed to and recovered from LPAI. We further investigate the effect of the dominant mode of transmission of an HPAI strain on the outcome of the epidemic. Four combinations of contact based direct transmission and indirect fecal-to-oral (or environmental) routes are examined. For a given infection peak of HPAI, indirect fecal-to-oral transmission of HPAI can lead to a higher death toll than that associated with direct transmission. The mitigating effect of LPAI can, in turn, be dependent on the route of infection of HPAI.

"33","21124892","Exploring cell tropism as a possible contributor to influenza infection severity.","
        Several mechanisms have been proposed to account for the marked increase in severity of human infections with avian compared to human influenza strains, including increased cytokine expression, poor immune response, and differences in target cell receptor affinity. Here, the potential effect of target cell tropism on disease severity is studied using a mathematical model for in-host influenza viral infection in a cell population consisting of two different cell types. The two cell types differ only in their susceptibility to infection and rate of virus production. We show the existence of a parameter regime which is characterized by high viral loads sustained long after the onset of infection. This finding suggests that differences in cell tropism between influenza strains could be sufficient to cause significant differences in viral titer profiles, similar to those observed in infections with certain strains of influenza A virus. The two target cell mathematical model offers good agreement with experimental data from severe influenza infections, as does the usual, single target cell model albeit with biologically unrealistic parameters. Both models predict that while neuraminidase inhibitors and adamantanes are only effective when administered early to treat an uncomplicated seasonal infection, they can be effective against more severe influenza infections even when administered late.

"34","21085662","Influenza virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) disrupts interferon signaling.","
        Type I interferons (IFNs) function as the first line of defense against viral infections by modulating cell growth, establishing an antiviral state and influencing the activation of various immune cells. Viruses such as influenza have developed mechanisms to evade this defense mechanism and during infection with influenza A viruses, the non-structural protein 1 (NS1) encoded by the virus genome suppresses induction of IFNs-α/β. Here we show that expression of avian H5N1 NS1 in HeLa cells leads to a block in IFN signaling. H5N1 NS1 reduces IFN-inducible tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1, STAT2 and STAT3 and inhibits the nuclear translocation of phospho-STAT2 and the formation of IFN-inducible STAT1:1-, STAT1:3- and STAT3:3- DNA complexes. Inhibition of IFN-inducible STAT signaling by NS1 in HeLa cells is, in part, a consequence of NS1-mediated inhibition of expression of the IFN receptor subunit, IFNAR1. In support of this NS1-mediated inhibition, we observed a reduction in expression of ifnar1 in ex vivo human non-tumor lung tissues infected with H5N1 and H1N1 viruses. Moreover, H1N1 and H5N1 virus infection of human monocyte-derived macrophages led to inhibition of both ifnar1 and ifnar2 expression. In addition, NS1 expression induces up-regulation of the JAK/STAT inhibitors, SOCS1 and SOCS3. By contrast, treatment of ex vivo human lung tissues with IFN-α results in the up-regulation of a number of IFN-stimulated genes and inhibits both H5N1 and H1N1 virus replication. The data suggest that NS1 can directly interfere with IFN signaling to enhance viral replication, but that treatment with IFN can nevertheless override these inhibitory effects to block H5N1 and H1N1 virus infections.

        The surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) helps the influenza A virus to evade the host immune system by antigenic variation and is a major driving force for viral evolution. In this study, the selection pressure on HA of H5N1 influenza A virus was analyzed using bioinformatics algorithms. Most of the identified positive selection (PS) sites were found to be within or adjacent to epitope sites. Some of the identified PS sites are consistent with previous experimental studies, providing further support to the biological significance of our findings. The highest frequency of PS sites was observed in recent strains isolated during 2005-2007. Phylogenetic analysis was also conducted on HA sequences from various hosts. Viral drift is almost similar in both avian and human species with a progressive trend over the years. Our study reports new mutations in functional regions of HA that might provide markers for vaccine design or can be used to predict isolates of pandemic potential.

        We analyzed the dynamics of an influenza A/Albany/1/98 (H3N2) viral infection, using a set of mathematical models highlighting the differences between in vivo and in vitro infection. For example, we found that including virion loss due to cell entry was critical for the in vitro model but not for the in vivo model. Experiments were performed on influenza virus-infected MDCK cells in vitro inside a hollow-fiber (HF) system, which was used to continuously deliver the drug amantadine. The HF system captures the dynamics of an influenza infection, and is a controlled environment for producing experimental data which lend themselves well to mathematical modeling. The parameter estimates obtained from fitting our mathematical models to the HF experimental data are consistent with those obtained earlier for a primary infection in a human model. We found that influenza A/Albany/1/98 (H3N2) virions under normal experimental conditions at 37 degrees C rapidly lose infectivity with a half-life of approximately 6.6+/-0.2 h, and that the lifespan of productively infected MDCK cells is approximately 13 h. Finally, using our models we estimated that the maximum efficacy of amantadine in blocking viral infection is approximately 74%, and showed that this low maximum efficacy is likely due to the rapid development of drug resistance.

        A pandemic outbreak of viral influenza could occur if highly virulent zoonotic strains (such as avian H5N1) were to acquire the ability to transmit among humans. This possibility has increased concern, interest, and investigation in the influenza field.

A recurring theme was that H5N1 viruses and the now-available reassortant/recombinant viruses from the 1918 pandemic have striking pathological and molecular similarities. Understanding these similarities, and how the viruses differ from currently circulating strains will be critical for timely preparation of the appropriate vaccines and antiviral therapies if a new pandemic should arise. To that end, this international conference was a fully comprehensive exchange of information covering public health, pandemic planning/preparedness, current and developing vaccines, animal ecology/zoonosis, mathematical modeling, virology, and viral immunology.

        The 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, generated a great deal of attention around the ability of Canada's health system to respond to a health crisis. This event underscored a very serious reality--on the whole, Canada's health system was not prepared to quickly and efficiently deal with a health emergency. This reality was particularly clear in Canada's largest city, Toronto, as the hospital system was not able to contain the outbreak. Armed with little knowledge of the nature of the threat or epidemiology of the disease, the health system was overwhelmed with how to deal with this crisis. Perhaps of greatest concern, however, was the inability to provide accurate and timely information to health institutions, healthcare workers and the public regarding the appropriate procedures and precautions to ensure optimal safety for all persons and control the spread of disease. This paper makes the case that the integration of occupational health and safety into pandemic planning is key to its success.

        Virology laboratories historically have used direct fluorescent-antibody assay (DFA) and culture to detect six or seven respiratory viruses. Following the discovery of five new human respiratory viruses since 2000, there is an increasing need for diagnostic tests to detect these emerging viruses. We have developed a new test that can detect 20 different respiratory virus types/subtypes in a single 5-h test. The assay employs multiplex PCR using 14 virus-specific primer pairs, followed by a multiplexed target-specific primer extension (TSPE) reaction using 21 primers for specific respiratory virus types and subtypes. TSPE products were sorted and identified by using a fluid microsphere-based array (Universal Array; TmBioscience Corporation, Toronto, Canada) and the Luminex x-MAP system. The assay detected influenza A and B viruses; influenza A virus subtypes H1, H3, and H5 (including subtype H5N1 of the Asian lineage); parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, 3, and 4; respiratory syncytial virus types A and B; adenovirus; metapneumovirus; rhinovirus; enterovirus; and coronaviruses OC43, 229E, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, NL63, and HKU1. In a prospective evaluation using 294 nasopharyngeal swab specimens, DFA/culture detected 119 positives and the respiratory virus panel (RVP) test detected 112 positives, for a sensitivity of 97%. The RVP test detected an additional 61 positive specimens that either were not detected by DFA/culture or were positive for viruses not tested for by DFA/culture. After resolution of discordant results by using a second unique PCR assay and by using a combined reference standard of positivity, the RVP test detected 180 of 183 true positives, for a sensitivity of 98.5%, whereas DFA and culture detected only 126 of 183 true positives, for a sensitivity of 68.8%. The RVP test should improve the capabilities of hospital and public health laboratories for diagnosing viral respiratory tract infections and should assist public health agencies in identifying etiologic agents in respiratory tract infection outbreaks.

        It is not understood how immune inflammation influences the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). One area of strong controversy is the role of interferon (IFN) responses in the natural history of SARS. The fact that the majority of SARS patients recover after relatively moderate illness suggests that the prevailing notion of deficient type I IFN-mediated immunity, with hypercytokinemia driving a poor clinical course, is oversimplified. We used proteomic and genomic technology to systematically analyze host innate and adaptive immune responses of 40 clinically well-described patients with SARS during discrete phases of illness from the onset of symptoms to discharge or a fatal outcome. A novel signature of high IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma, and IFN-stimulated chemokine levels, plus robust antiviral IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression, accompanied early SARS sequelae. As acute illness progressed, SARS patients entered a crisis phase linked to oxygen saturation profiles. The majority of SARS patients resolved IFN responses at crisis and expressed adaptive immune genes. In contrast, patients with poor outcomes showed deviated ISG and immunoglobulin gene expression levels, persistent chemokine levels, and deficient anti-SARS spike antibody production. We contend that unregulated IFN responses during acute-phase SARS may culminate in a malfunction of the switch from innate immunity to adaptive immunity. The potential for the use of the gene signatures we describe in this study to better assess the immunopathology and clinical management of severe viral infections, such as SARS and avian influenza (H5N1), is therefore worth careful examination.

        Recent worldwide attention on influenza pandemics has mainly focused on planning and preparation. Some published plans appear to have missed some unique considerations relevant to children and youth, leaving a serious and potentially devastating gap in our pandemic response. This paper highlights those unique considerations and encourages health administrators and policy-makers to rise to the challenge and demonstrate leadership by ensuring that all institutions consider children and youth in their pandemic planning.

        Planning for the next influenza pandemic is occurring at many levels throughout the world, spurred on by the recent spread of H5N1 avian influenza in Asia, Europe, and Africa. Central to these planning efforts in the health-care sector are strategies to minimise the transmission of influenza to health-care workers and patients. The infection control precautions necessary to prevent airborne, droplet, and contact transmission are quite different and will need to be decided on and planned before a pandemic occurs. Despite vast clinical experience in human beings, there continues to be much debate about how influenza is transmitted. We have done a systematic review of the English language experimental and epidemiological literature on this subject to better inform infection control planning efforts. We have found that the existing data are limited with respect to the identification of specific modes of transmission in the natural setting. However, we are able to conclude that transmission occurs at close range rather than over long distances, suggesting that airborne transmission, as traditionally defined, is unlikely to be of significance in most clinical settings. Further research is required to better define conditions under which the influenza virus may transmit via the airborne route.

        In theory, influenza viruses can be transmitted through aerosols, large droplets, or direct contact with secretions (or fomites). These 3 modes are not mutually exclusive. Published findings that support the occurrence of aerosol transmission were reviewed to assess the importance of this mode of transmission. Published evidence indicates that aerosol transmission of influenza can be an important mode of transmission, which has obvious implications for pandemic influenza planning and in particular for recommendations about the use of N95 respirators as part of personal protective equipment.

        Concerns about emergence of a pandemic strain of influenza have been increasing. The strains of highly pathogenic influenza A(H5N1) currently circulating are considered among the most plausible candidates for giving rise to a pandemic strain. In this study the design and development of a RT-PCR assay specific for these highly pathogenic influenza A(H5) strains is presented. This is achieved in part by the design of a primer targeting the coding region for the protease cleavage site of the hemagglutinin, and another primer derived from a pan-hemagglutinin RT-PCR assay also presented in this study. It is shown that the HPAI A(H5) specific assay amplifies only the nucleic acids of highly pathogenic A(H5), with a high sensitivity.

        Influenza viruses are important infections in transplant recipients. They may lead to complications including viral pneumonia, secondary bacterial infections and graft dysfunction. There has been a recent widespread outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza among domestic poultry and wild birds along with a number of human cases with severe disease and high mortality. Genetic changes in the H5N1 virus may lead to efficient human-to-human transmission, heralding the onset of the next influenza pandemic. Discussed are the implications that such a pandemic may have on transplant patients. Logical inferences can be made from data on influenza in transplant patients and from experience with other respiratory virus outbreaks. In the event of a pandemic, it is likely that transplant patients will have more severe disease and higher mortality as compared to the general population. Vaccination and antiviral strategies may be less effective in this population. Implications for transplant programs in general are also discussed.
